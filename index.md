**Hey, sonny if somethin's been botherin' you. I'm willing to give you a listen.**

| | |
|-|-|
| My relationships...	| good - irritable
| My future...	
| I have no worries.	

**Have you made an appointment, ho?**

| | |
|-|-|

**Maybe I should try something new! I don't want to fall into mediocrity, ho...**

| | |
|-|-|

**Hell, I got all sorta girls lined up if you're into that.**

| | |
|-|-|

**How 'bout we have an interview? You're the winner, after all. I'll listen to whatever you gotta say.**

| | |
|-|-|

**You carry a gun because you think it'll make you more popular with the girls?**

| | |
|-|-|

**It's no fun going home when only my annoying mom and dad are there.**

| | |
|-|-|

**Me not understand in what way you superior to me...**

| | |
|-|-|

**You go back to your mother' arms. You need take nap now.**

| | |
|-|-|

**I insist you surrender yourself to the authorities.**

| | |
|-|-|

**I occasionally wish to pamper myself as a reward for working hard. How would you do that?**

| | |
|-|-|

**Why're you so desperate?**

| | |
|-|-|

**That's whack, man. Maybe you should get your head checked out.**

| | |
|-|-|

**Care to explain yourself? I certainly hope you have a good reason for this boorish treatment.**

| | |
|-|-|

**Why have you decided to be more communicative with me?**

| | |
|-|-|

**...So? What's going to happen to me now?**

| | |
|-|-|

**I wanted to go on vacation, too, before all this happened...**

| | |
|-|-|

**...I'm not going to go easy on you for doing something like this, you know...**

| | |
|-|-|


**You do understand that I'm here because people like you exist, right?**

| | |
|-|-|


**I wonder if us speaking together like this now means that we are somehow connected...**

| | |
|-|-|


**What you thinking now?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Me guessing you have power that me not have. But what is it...?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Humans always want either an autograph or a self-hee, ho. Which is it, ho?**

| | |
|-|-|


**My only choice now... is to retire, ho.**

| | |
|-|-|


**...I gotta ask. How do you train?**

| | |
|-|-|


**In the end, killin' me's just a waste of yer time and energy. You get what I'm sayin', right?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Hey mister, if I grew up, what do you think the future me would've been like?**

| | |
|-|-|


**I'll go out with you just for today if there are no strings attached.**

| | |
|-|-|


**Couldn't you at least make me a cup of tea or somethin'? Hell, that's e real polite.**

| | |
|-|-|


**...How 'bout you, sonny? What kinda trip do you wanna take?**

| | |
|-|-|


**So... You enjoy teasing older women like this?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Is there a reason why I just can't beat you?**

| | |
|-|-|


**That's how I feel. And is it not pitiable when one denies one's feelings to oneself?**

| | |
|-|-|


**I've been sending you serious "don't speak to me" vibes.**

| | |
|-|-|


**Know how they say, "Be kind ta yer elders"? Has no one ever taught you that?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Is there really any benefit for me if I joined with you?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Why you come all the way here?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Me want to ask some recommendations, so me can at least imagine.**

| | |
|-|-|


**When you were little, what did you wanna be when you grow up?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Maybe kids got spanked a long time ago, but people don't do that anymore, right?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Do you think they really mean it all the time?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Man, I'm about ta be a victim of that too. Hell, does this country even have a future?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Do you not understand the severity of your action?**

| | |
|-|-|


**What do you hope to accomplish by injuring me further...?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Guess what I want you to read to me before you tuck me into bed!**

| | |
|-|-|


**When you eat curry, mister, what do you like to add?**

| | |
|-|-|


**I lost. Here I lay, at your feet, at your mercy. Just what do you want from me?**

| | |
|-|-|


**You not worry you get in trouble if those groups hear what you are doing to me?**

| | |
|-|-|


**You given much thought, what if you go to place where you could die at any moment?**

| | |
|-|-|


**If that's the plan, well you better make sure I'm satisfied.**

| | |
|-|-|


**Me really want to eat something.**

| | |
|-|-|


**...It's true, isn't it?**

| | |
|-|-|


**So why me in this situation right now? Why me at your mercy?**

| | |
|-|-|


**If you capture me, what you going to do to me?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Why you keep trampling here? What you humans thinking?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Me no curse you, but me curse your commander! Me curse the one who order you...!**

| | |
|-|-|


**So me am going to haunt you for the rest of your life. Me always right behind you...**

| | |
|-|-|


**There something you want say to me, right?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Well, I need to see myself home soon...**

| | |
|-|-|


**Wouldn't your girlfriend get jealous if she could see us?**

| | |
|-|-|


**I'll make you into soup.**

| | |
|-|-|


**Seriously, cosplaying in a place like this? Are you just really freakin' bored?**

| | |
|-|-|


**Did I lose... ?**

| | |
|-|-|


**You have no idea I was about to use my ultimate move.**

| | |
|-|-|


**What kind of guys piss you off?**

| | |
|-|-|


**It's pretty rude, man.**

| | |
|-|-|
